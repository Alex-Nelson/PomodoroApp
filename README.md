What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo, uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

There are six steps in the original technique:
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings take a short break (traditionally 5 to 10 minutes).
5. If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, repeat to Step 2.

A goal of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.

About This App

This app allows the user to have a list of tasks, each with its own timers and number of pomodoros (interval of time spent working). These values can be edited at any time while the task is saved in the app's internal Room database. The task can also be deleted when the user no longer needs it. The user can either start each timer individually or click the toggle to have the timers auto-start.
